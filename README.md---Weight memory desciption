WEIGHT MEMORY WORKING --SIGNALS---WORKING
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The weight memory is used in the neuron for the INPUTS . 
This weight memory can be used as a ROM and RAM , since this is a pre-trained model beign implemented for now , the functionality of ROM is utilized .

The inputs : clk, write enable , read enable, write address, read address, write input 
Output : write out.

When used as ROM :In case of using this unit as ROM , the file containing the inputs and the number of memory locations, and the data to be used.
This file will be in BINARY format. This file is MIF- memory initialization file (specific to XILINX vivado).

When used as RAM :In case od using this as a RAM , the inputs are obtained externally , the signals like write enable. 
Assigning the address and input , writes the data into the memory locations.

Reading the written data:
The data is read by the signal read_enable and in sync with the clock cycle.
